## The Problem

We want you to create a command-line application that reads a listing of game results for a soccer league as a stream and returns the top teams at the end of each matchday.

### Input/output

The input and output will be text. To keep things simple a static file will be used to represent the input stream of game results. Your solution should read and process game results one at a time by reading the provided sample-input.txt file, via stdin (pipe or redirect) or as a file path passed as input argument.

Your solution should then output the correct result via stdout to the console.

The input contains results of games, one per line and grouped by matchday. All teams play exactly once during a matchday, e.g. given a league of six teams, each matchday would consist of three games. There is no specific delimiter between matchdays so your application should recognize the start and end of a matchday. See sample-input.txt as an example.

After reading and processing a game result, if this is the end of a matchday, your solution should output the top three teams, ordered from most to least points. If this is not the end of a matchday, your solution should move on to
the next game result. See the expected format specified in expected-output.txt.

You can expect that the input will be well-formed. Bonus points if your solution handles a few basic error cases.

### The rules

In this league, a draw (tie) is worth 1 point and a win is worth 3 points. A loss is worth 0 points. If two or more teams among the top three teams have the same number of points, they should have the same rank and be printed in alphabetical order. That said, at most three teams should be listed in the output per matchday.
